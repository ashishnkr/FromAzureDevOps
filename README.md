# FromAzureDevOps

This is a practice code which I have been creating from 2016. This code is also being hosted on private Azure DevOps repository (previously VSTS, just like TFS but hosted on Microsoft cloud). Choosing the share some of the projects created and worked upon during learning to code and going through various concepts of C# .NET programming and Design Patterns involved in it.

All Folders inside repository represents different topics usually indicated by the folder name itself.

Use Visual Studio 2019 to open any solution inside this repository. Projects were created on different versions of Visual Studio over the time. Hence, VS 2019 will take care of back compatibility.

Check the DotNetDesignPatternDemos directory which is an extension to another Github Repository and the content of this repository has many advanced implementation.
